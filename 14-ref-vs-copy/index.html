    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let teams3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[2] = "CJ";
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Bob";
    console.log(team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 77;
    console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(capt2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const capt3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wes.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
